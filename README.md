# Maintenance-cost-reduction-through-predictive-techniques

## BACKGROUND
A company has a fleet of devices transmitting daily telemetry readings. They would like to create a predictive
maintenance solution to proactively identify when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost
savings over routine or time-based preventive maintenance, because tasks are performed only when warranted.

## GOAL
You are tasked with building a predictive model using machine learning to predict the probability of a device failure.
When building this model, be sure to minimize false positives and false negatives. The column you are trying to predict
is called failure with binary value 0 for non-failure and 1 for failure.

** Important Highlights
1. VIF
2. Resampling Using Pandas
3. LabelEncoder
4. Bagging and Boosting
5. LGBMClassifier
